<!-- generate a contributing.md file -->

## Thank you for your contributing to this SDK, kindly follow the guidelines below:

- Create a fork of the repository.
- Create a new branch for your contribution.
- Add your contribution to the new branch and push your changes.
- Submit a pull request to the dev branch.
- The pull request will be merged to the dev branch and then to the master branch.

**Recommended**: It is possible that the dev/main branch would have been updated before you made a contribution so you can frequently keep rebasing off the main branch while you make your contributions. i.e

- fetch from origin

```
$ git fetch origin
```

- then you can rebase off the main branch like so:

```
$ git rebase origin/main
```

This will keep your changes in sync with the main branch and most importantly, the git history will be clean and releasable.
